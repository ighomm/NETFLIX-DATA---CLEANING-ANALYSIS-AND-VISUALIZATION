ðŸ“º Netflix Data â€“ Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization
Welcome to the Netflix Data project! This project explores, cleans, and visualizes data from Netflix's catalog, uncovering trends in content types, ratings, release years, countries, and more. The goal is to apply data cleaning techniques and extract meaningful insights using Python and popular data science libraries.

ðŸ“Œ Objectives
Clean raw Netflix dataset using pandas.

Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Visualize data using matplotlib and seaborn to reveal patterns and trends.

ðŸ§ª Technologies Used
Python 3

Pandas â€“ for data cleaning and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ for visualization

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab â€“ for interactive coding and presentation

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Tasks
Dropped irrelevant or null values.

Converted date columns to datetime format.

Cleaned inconsistencies in categorical columns like Country, Director, and Cast.

Removed duplicate records.

ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights
Content Type Analysis: Comparison of Movies vs TV Shows.

Year-wise Release Trend: Analyzing how content production has evolved over the years.

Top Countries: Where most Netflix content comes from.

Genre Distribution: Common categories and trends in genres.

Director and Cast Frequency: Frequent collaborations or appearances.

ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
The notebook includes:

Bar plots for country-wise and year-wise content release.

Pie charts for content types.

Heatmaps for correlation.

Word clouds for titles and genres (optional enhancement).

ðŸ“¥ Dataset
Source: Kaggle Netflix Titles Dataset

File: netflix_titles.csv

Records: Over 7,700 entries about Netflix content including title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, and more.

ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone this repo or download the notebook.

Open it in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Upload netflix_titles.csv if not already included.

Run each cell step-by-step to see the full analysis.

âœ… Future Improvements
Integrate interactive visualizations (e.g., Plotly or Dash).

Build a content recommendation engine.

Sentiment analysis on title descriptions.

Time-series trend prediction using ML models.
